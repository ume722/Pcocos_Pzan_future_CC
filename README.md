This repository contains multivariate environmental similarity surfaces (MESS) anlyses results as GeoTIFF raster layers for P. cocos and P. zanzibaricus. Each file represents a specific
species, global circulation model (GCM), shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP), and timeline.
# example: Pzan_IP_245_4160
## Pzan = species (Paragalago zanzibaricus)
## IP = GCM used (in this case, GCM = IPSL-CM6A-LR)
## 245 = SSP used (in this case, SSP 245)
## 4160 = timeline assessed (in this case, 2041 - 2060)
